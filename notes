There is the formage project which attempts to build forms from models for admin GUIs. You might want to check on that. There possibly are other similar projects too.

Now I realize that that was of course not what the question was aiming for, but I will record a possible way to do it here:

If you wish to implement these things, you might go the following route:

Use sessions.
Implement your models using sequelize or mongoose.
Implement authentication using lockit or passport (or any other authn framework).
Implement authorization using node-acl (or any other authz framework of your choosing)
Implement the desired CRUD functionality using e. g. formage project.
